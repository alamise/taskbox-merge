iOS Ports
=========

   iOS Ports is a Collection of F/OSS libraries which have been ported to
   the iPhoneOS/iOS platform.  The conditions of the license of each package
   included in iOS Ports are believed to allow for use of each package on
   an iOS device, however a developer should review the license of each
   package before including it within an application and to verify that the
   application meets the requirements of the conditions.

Packages
========

   Cyrus SASL
   Location:      ports/security/cyrus-sasl
   Depends Upon:  security/openssl
   Description:   A port of Cyrus SASL to the iPhone platform (iOS). An open
                  source implementations of Simple Authentication and Security
                  Layer methods.


   iOSPorts
   Location:      ports/iOSPorts
   Depends Upon:  n/a
   Description:   A standalone package for adding iOS Port packages' copyright
                  information to an iOS package.  Using this library to
                  display the copyright information should fulfill a packages
                  distribution requirement according to the Modified BSD
                  license and similar licenses. Including this project in an
                  iOS application will not make other iOS Ports packages
                  available within an application.


   OpenLDAP
   Location:     ports/database/openldap
   Depends Upon: security/cyrus-sasl
   Desciption:   A port of OpenLDAP client library to the iOS platform.


   OpenSSL
   Location:      ports/security/openssl
   Depends Upon:  n/a
   Description:   A port of OpenSSL's SSL/TLS and Crypto toolkit to the iPhone
                  platform (iOS).


   PCRE
   Location:      ports/devel/pcre
   Depends Upon:  n/a
   Description:   A port of PCRE (Perl Compatible Regular Expressions) to the
                  iOS platform (iPhone).


Quick Start for Xcode 4.1
=========================

Needs to be written.


Quick Start for Xcode 3.2
=========================

   Disclaimer:
      I wrote this in five minutes. More documentation will be following over
      the next month or two.  If you would like to assist with documentation
      and tutorials, please contact David M. Syzdek <syzdek@bindlebinaries.com>.

   Assumptions:
      - You understand basic use and navigation of the Xcode interface.
      - You understand basic concepts behind static libraries and header files.
      - You are using the software listed in the "Required Software" section.
      - iOSPorts has been downloaded to /Users/syzdek/development/com.bindlebinaries/iOSPorts
           (Change the above path to the location you downloaded iOSPorts)

   1) Open your project in Xcode.

   2) Open the project settings. From the menubar:

         Project -> Edit Project Settings

   3) Open the "Build" tab. Search for "Header Search Paths", Add the following:

         /Users/syzdek/development/com.bindlebinaries/iOSPorts/include

      This step instructs Xcode where to look for include headers when using
      libraries from iOSPorts.

   4) Add the required iOSPorts Xcode project files to your project by using
      the wizard found on the menubar:

         Project -> Add To Project...

   5) Open the target settings for your application (double click on the
      target).

   6) Open the "General" tab. Add iOSPorts dependencies by clicking the '+'
      button below the "Direct Dependencies" panel and then selecting the
      libraries from the drop down window.

   7) Link the libraries to your target. From the "Groups & Files" panel in
      Xcode's main window, drag the libraries from the iOSPorts Xcode projects
      to the "Link Binary with Libraries" group within your target.

   Your application should now be linked against the iOSPorts libraries you
   setup.

   Please note that since the iOS SDK does not allow creating shared libraries
   for the iOS platform, you must also link all required dependent libraries.
   For instance, to use libldap.a and liblber.a from OpenLDAP, you must also
   link libsasl2.a from Cyrus SASL, libssl.a from OpenSSL, and libcrypto.a from
   OpenSSL.  The dependencies are listed in the packages list above.

   An example application using iOS Ports is available from:
